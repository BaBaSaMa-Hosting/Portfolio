# The First Portfolio

### written on 13 Nov 2022

## The Design

![Alt Text](/images/babasama.com.old.png)
Basic concept was having a text that animate the typing of the sentence. From there on I had a rough design and some old photos of mine to add to the design and develope from there. I use figma to draw out the proportion of the screen to show case the text and the picture. I also thought of after exiting the hovering of the picture i want to change it to a different picture to allow showcase of projects.

## The Development

Github Link: [The Project Source Code](https://github.com/BaBaSaMa-Hosting/Main)

It was easy to develop the foundation of the code but it wasn't easy to maintain it. I written it in default HTML, SASS and JS with JQuery. It was working but it wasn't good in terms of the standards among other developers. So i quickly finish it off and start learning and working on other projects. I was also studying at the time so i didnt had much thoughts.

I came across a problem when comes to hosting. I was not as good as currently and understanding when comes to self hosting. So i use Fastify to host even though I had no reason to use nodeJS hosting since all I'm doing static sites.
